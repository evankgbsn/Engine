Blender Animated Model Workflow:
-Create Mesh
-Model Mesh in Edit Mode
-Select all vertices in mesh and create a smart UV project
-Edit UVs/save/export image of UV map
-Go to Object Mode with the model selected by pressing tab and create an "Armature"
-Parent the mesh with automatic weights to the bones of the armature.
-Create keyframes by advancing the track and inserting them with "I" for location, rotation, and scale (make sure that the mouse is hovered over the viewer and not the track.).
-Save the animation in the dope sheets action editor. Give it a cool name.
-Use proper export settings.
